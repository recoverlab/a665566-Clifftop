            This “Ombudsmanship” authority record may be treated as being its own expressive origin from which qualities of derivation are created.

            As <span style="font-weight: bold">लक्ष्मी</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold" property="hasAppellation">Lakṣmī</span>, is the very first expression of my ombudsmanship interest, from which further schemata and so forth might develop, this authority record may be unique in its referencing of the bibliographic world beyond. The bibliographic relationships this record has with other few records is mostly what the content of its intention is. Attributes can be described at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/a665566/clifftop/wikis/लक्ष्मी">next level</a> of classification, while referential focus on the entities their selves is given one level beyond that.
            <br /><br />
            The Vedic goddess Lakṣmī is the life within the voice of what love truly is. The word “<a href="https://ombudsmanship.gitlab.io/clifftop/love.html">love</a>” itself maintains its own record-worthiness, but together with her masculine god <a href="https://ombudsmanship.gitlab.io/clifftop/विष्णु.html">विष्णु</a> (Viṣṇu), Lakṣmī is the primary love goddess in this type of three-dimensional universe within which we presently live. Her relationship with him is stronger than integral, and so his record has been linked from this one, as is her own identification with the vertically adjacent goddess <a href="https://ombudsmanship.gitlab.io/clifftop/रोहिणी.html">रोहिणी</a> (Rohiṇī).
            <br /><br />
            Trans-Venusian identifications can be referenced from other records, as can the details of bibliographic work be managed in connection with Viṣṇu’s role. Any other aspects of ombudsmanship can likewise be his to pursue and develop and explain. Her place in this exact origin of authoritative expression is gratia.
