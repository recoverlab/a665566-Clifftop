            This “Clifftop” authority record may be treated as being the valued expression of its “<a href="https://ombudsmanship.gitlab.io/clifftop/लक्ष्मी.html">Ombudsmanship</a>” origin, from both of which, qualities of derivation are created.

            As <span style="font-weight: bold">लक्ष्मी</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold">Lakṣmī</span>, is the prime goddess in this type of three-dimensional universe within which we presently live, this authority record is almost unique in its referencing of our bibliographic relativities. Her essential attributes should be described in this record, while referential focus on her identification as a bibliographic entity has its place with the <a href="http://scarecrow.referata.com/wiki/लक्ष्मी">adjacent level</a> of this “scheme.”
            <br /><br />
            The Vedic Lakṣmī is the life within the voice of what love truly is. The word “<a href="love.html">love</a>” itself maintains its own record-worthiness, but together with her masculine god <a href="विष्णु.html">विष्णु</a> (Viṣṇu), Lakṣmī is the love goddess of this Solar System. Her relationship with Viṣṇu is stronger than integral, and her integration with him, who art the soul of <a href="राम.html">राम</a> (Rāma), their goddess <a href="तुलसी.html">तुलसी</a> (Tulasī) being at that level the soul of Rāma’s <a href="सीता.html">सीता</a> (Sītā), is of great significance in the development of <a href="Lākṣmism.html">Lākṣma</a> mythology. Likewise her identification with anthropo-cosmically adjacent goddess <a href="रोहिणी.html">रोहिणी</a> (Rohiṇī), Viṣṇu being <a href="चन्द्र.html">चन्द्र</a> (Candra) and Tulasī being <a href="कृत्तिका.html">कृत्तिका</a> (Kṛttikā) in that relativity, is important to the story of whom they are.
            <br /><br />
            Trans-Venusian identifications can be referenced from still other records than this one is, as can the details of bibliographic work be managed in connection with Viṣṇu’s role. Any other aspects of justification in this aspect of their professionalism can likewise be his to pursue and develop and explain. Her place in this origin of authoritative expression is close but emphasizes faceted homemaking within the greater expanse that this universe is becoming.
